# What is this page?
This page shows the R code for analysis to compare sediment risk assessments based on two diffeent approaches: the equilibrium partitioning (EqP) theory and spiked-sediment toxicity tests. The corresponding manuscript is now in preparation.
  
  
   
# Introduction  
Sediment quality guidelines for nonionic hydrophobic chemicals have been developed through two different methods: **the EqP theory** and **spiked-sediment tests**. It is still not conclusive whether using the EqP approach or spiked-sediment test is more appropriate to develop sediment quality guidelines. 
Here we show the R code and dataset to analyze the relationship SSDs between based on the EqP approach and spiked-sediment tests, which can reproduce the results in XXXXX (manuscript in preparation).
